# How we handle versioning

Current Minor Version: __2018-05-15__ 

Pioneered by [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com), we follow a similar minor-versioning system that allows API
consumers to lock into a version to ensure that when a backwards-incompatible
change is made to our API, your application is not affected - and when you are
ready to use the latest version simply update the `Modio-Version` header to
the latest version.

### Supplying the version header
```shell
Example cURL request
---------------------
curl -X GET https://api.mod.io/v1/games \
	-H 'Modio-Version: 2018-05-15' \
	-d 'api_key: 0d0ba6756d032246f1299f8c01abc424'	\
```

```http
Example HTTP Header Response
---------------------
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
...
...
Modio-Version: 2018-05-15
```
When you make a request, setting the version of mod.io you want to use is easy.
To specify the versionof the API you want to use, simply suppy the `Modio-Version` header 
with a valid version date that we have released (YYYY-MM-DD format) as shown in the code example on the right.

### Handling invalid versions

When using a supplied version, you need to be sure you know what functionality is available to you
and what you can expect the API to do under every situation. With that said, and in the interest of
being as explicit as possible if you supply a version that falls under any of the following coniditions,
a `400 Bad Request` will be returned in the form of an [Error Object](https://docs.mod.io/#error-object).

- Not in the correct format (`YYYY-MM-DD`)
- Not a version listed below in the [changelog](#api-versions) section

## What are incompatible changes

The benefit of this system is we can push backwards-incompatible changes out of necessity
and your application is not affected. To clarify, for the mod.io API the following
are what constitutes as __backwards-incompatible__ changes:

Backwards Compatible (not covered by these docs) | Backwards Incompatible (breaking)
---------- | ----------  
Adding a new field to an object | Modifying or removing a field in an object
Adding new objects to a response | Modifying any code returned by a request
Adding new headers to a request/response | Modifying any error code returned by _any_ endpoint
Adding new events | Modifying or removing an endpoint's path
Changing the ordering of items in a response  | Modifying or removing any request/response header
  
Changes that _are_ backwards-compatible will continue to be delivered to you, only breaking
changes as described above will fall under the minor versioning system.
