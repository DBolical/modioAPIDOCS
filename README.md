# mod.io API Documentation
Documentation for [mod.io](https://mod.io) is powered by [slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), a static API generator. We use [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/) to define our API from comments in our codebase, and generate the slate markdown files from it using [widdershins](https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins).

## Output
We recommend you don't edit source/index.html.md as this file is generated automatically via the above process. You can edit the presentation and source/includes/\_modio.md as these are manually created.

## Setup
To get our [slate documentation](https://docs.mod.io) up and running on your local machine, we recommend you follow the instructions on the [official slate repository](https://github.com/lord/slate) page.

## Contributions Welcome
Want to correct errors in our documentation or it's layout? Submit a pull request with your recommended changes to be reviewed.

## Other Repositories
Our aim with [mod.io](https://mod.io), is to provide an open modding API. You are welcome to view, fork and contribute to our other codebases in use:

* [Design](https://design.mod.io) is public and open source, the repository can be [found here](https://github.com/DBolical/modioDESIGN).
* [SDK](https://sdk.mod.io) is public and open source, the repository with documentation can be [found here](https://github.com/DBolical/modioSDK). Game developers are welcome to utilize it directly, to add support for mods in their games, or extend it to create plugins and wrappers for other engines and codebases.
* [Browse engine tools](https://apps.mod.io), plugins and wrappers created by the community, or [share your own](https://apps.mod.io/add).
* [Unity plugin](https://github.com/DBolical/modioUNITY), easily manage the browsing and install of mods in Unity Engine games.
