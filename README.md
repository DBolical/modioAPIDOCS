# mod.works API Documentation
Documentation for [mod.works](https://mod.works) is powered by [slate](https://github.com/lord/slate) a static API generator. We use [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/) to define our API from comments in our codebase, and generate the slate markdown files from it using [widdershins](https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins).

## Output
We recommend you don't edit source/\_modworks.md as this file is generated automatically via the above process.
