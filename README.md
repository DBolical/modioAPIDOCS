Documentation for [mod.io](https://mod.io) is powered by [slate](https://github.com/lord/slate), a static API generator and can be [read here](https://docs.mod.io) (also see our [getting started guide](https://apps.mod.io/guides/getting-started)). We use [swagger.io](https://swagger.io/) to define our API from comments in our codebase, and generate the slate markdown files from it using [widdershins](https://github.com/Mermade/widdershins).

## Output
We recommend you don't edit source/index.html.md as this file is generated automatically via the above process. You can edit the presentation and source/includes/\_modio.md as these are manually created.

## Setup
To get our [slate documentation](https://docs.mod.io) up and running on your local machine, we recommend you follow the instructions on the [official slate repository](https://github.com/lord/slate) page.
